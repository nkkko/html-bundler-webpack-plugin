# RSPack and HTML Bundler

A symbiosis of the fast RSPack and the powerful [html-bundler-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webdiscus/html-bundler-webpack-plugin) could be a `Vite` killer.

But currently RSPack `v0.5.6` is yet not 100% compatible with the Webpack.

Using the `html-bundler-webpack-plugin` with `RSPack` occurs the issue:

```

                                                     ^
